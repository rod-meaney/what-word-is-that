# what-word-is-that

This is a project that I created with the sole purpose of teaching myself how to do React front and programming.  Having said that the source code for the React clients is in 2 other projects.  This makes this project three parts

 - [UI for optional authenticated game](https://github.com/rod-meaney/guess-word) : A React Bootstrap application (read directory in this repository contains the build)
 - [UI for authenticated list management](https://github.com/rod-meaney/guess-word-edit) : A React Bootstrap application (edit directory in this repository contains the build)
 - Backend and API's for the 2 frontend modules : Google Cloud App Engine application deployed to [Google App Engine](https://what-word-is-that.appspot.com/) utilising Google Big Table.
